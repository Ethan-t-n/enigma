## disclaimer 
I wrote down a few comments here in there in my project so I can remind myself of the process and show new things i've learned as well as blockers.
I am probably the last one to finish the project, but that is entirely my fault because I spent an abundance of time on google, stack overflow, reddit, 
and even resorted to youtube at some points (advice for myself, never use youtube again). I feel heavily dependant on google. 

## self evaluation 
Functionality - 3 Meets Expectations. I have not finished the cracking class so far, due to me not knowing where to start. I assume it will
be simular to the other classes, I may be overthinking it.

Object Oriented Programming - 2 Below Expectations. I don't know if I have the appropriate amount of classes.

Ruby Conventions - 3 Meets Expectations. I think I have the appropriate syntax as well as good spacing and line length.

Test Driven Development - 2 Below Expectations. There were a lot of times I was on a mini "writtings tests roll" and completely forgot to commit; However,
all tests are passing so far (I would write maybe 2-3 tests before I remember). My coverage was at 98% until I deleted what I thought was unnecessary last minute without checking my spec helper.

Version Control - 4 Above Expectations. I have more than 40 commits as well as more than 4 pull requests.
